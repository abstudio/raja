Hello I'm Raja, i'm young project of developer Vladimir Kalmykov (@morulus) which is a alternative way to parse and edit HTML doc. I created for super fast HTML parsing and manipulation it through selectors and methods. I'm faster and lighter, but i'm still young. I'm still not complete, but I'm working on it!

## Usage me
Get html code and use Raja function.
```php
$ra = Raja($myhtmlcode);
```
Now _$ra_ is our html document. Now we can find any element and manage it like in jQuery.
```php
$ra->getElementById('h1')->html();
```
